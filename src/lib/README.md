# Lib

Framework integration and cross-cutting concerns:

- `i18n/` – next-intl config and navigation helpers
- `routes/` – role-based route patterns and guards
- `next-auth/` – Auth.js setup and helpers
- `http/` – axios utilities
- `theme/`, `storage/`, `tools/` – misc utilities

Use these from features and components; avoid circular deps.
